      <h5 data-m="0">infinitesimal</h5>

      <p data-m="0" data-d="1">I'm going to talk about the concept of the infinitesimal. The infinitesimal is a concept that was developed by the mathematician Leibniz. The idea is that you can take a curve and you can break it down into infinitesimal parts. An infinitesimal part is a part that is so small that it is almost zero. It's not quite zero, but it's almost zero. And the idea is that you can take a curve and you can break it down into these infinitesimal parts and then you can add them up to find the area under the curve. This is the concept of the integral, which is a fundamental concept in calculus.
